# Focus Flow Timer

Focus Flow is a simple Pomodoro-style timer designed to help you manage your time and stay focused. The timer allows you to set a custom time duration, start, stop, and reset the timer, and even play a sound when the timer reaches zero. It also features a smooth transition effect for the buttons when hovered.

## Features

- **Customizable Timer**: Set your preferred time in minutes.
- **Start/Stop Timer**: Start and stop the timer as needed.
- **Sound Notification**: Plays a sound when the timer reaches zero and stops after 8 seconds.
- **Smooth Button Animation**: Buttons come up slightly when hovered over with a smooth transition.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **About Page**: Link to an "About" page for more details.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling and smooth transitions.
- **React Router**: For page navigation (e.g., navigating to the About page).
